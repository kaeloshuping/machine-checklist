Program description

Write a program that uses data from an excel spreadsheet, which contains meter readings for
different machine models (Full colour and monochrome), the program should be able to take the
last 3 digits of the machine serial number and allow you to modify the "CURRENT METER READINGS"
column and after submitting the modified data, the program should save the previous meter readings
(before modification) in the "PREVIOUS METER READING" column, once completed, the program should
calculate the difference between the "CURRENT METER READINGS" and "PREVIOUS METER READINGS" column
and store the difference in the "DIFFERENCE" column.

The program should as well be able to modify the "COMMENTS" column upon request, should the machine
condition in the "CONDITION" column be change from "WORKING" to "NOT WORKING"

The program should then update the data in the original excel sheet and saving the excel sheet to ready
for use in an email.

Program Mini Challenges

1: Obtain user input containing the machine name or serial number for columns to be modified (DONE)

2: Check whether user input belongs to "colour machines" or "B&W machines" in the case of serial numbers
    2.1: if serial number belongs to "B&W machines" only 1 user prompt for the "Black" meter reading should
         be obtained (DONE)
    2.2: if serial number belongs to "colour machines" then 3 user prompts should be given for the "Total", "Colour",
         "Black" meter readings respectively (DONE)
    2.3: prompt user whether they would like to modify any of the other columns ("CONDITION"/"COMMENTS") (DONE)

3: if user input is a machine name (finishing department equipment), prompt whether the user wants to modify the
   "CONDITION" or "COMMENTS" column

NB!!! IF THE "CONDITION" COLUMN IS MODIFIED, USER NEEDS TO MODIFY THE "COMMENTS" COLUMN UNLESS THE "CONDITION"
CHANGES FROM "NOT WORKING" TO "WORKING"!!!

4: Retrieve the meter readings in the "CURRENT METER READING", "PREVIOUS METER READING" and "DIFFERENCE" columns and
   save the column values in a variable in a dictionary format

5: Change the value for "PREVIOUS METER READING" to the value of "CURRENT METER READING"

6: Obtain user input for the new value of "CURRENT METER READING" (3 for colour machines and 1 for B&W machines)

7: Subtract the value of "PREVIOUS METER READING" from "CURRENT METER READING" and substitute the difference with the
   value saved in the variable containing the "DIFFERENCE" meter reading dictionary

8: Update the respective columns on the Excel sheet with the respective values obtained "CURRENT METER READING",
   "PREVIOUS METER READING" and "DIFFERENCE"

9: Save and close Excel file.
